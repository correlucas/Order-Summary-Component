## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive Design
- Custom hover states


### What I learned

I learned how to create a clean code, in my first attempt I used some useless divs, I tried my best to don't write useless tags. This challenge was really good to have an idea about how to wrap sections, 
prepare the website for mobile setting some breakup points and changing the way the elements are disposed as it stretch. Some cool stuff I added to my code was some custom hover states. 
I finally discoved how to create smooth transitions from the static element and hover element, this is a simple thing, but I have no idea how it was done until today.
